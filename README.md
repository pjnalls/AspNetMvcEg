![example workflow](https://github.com/pjnalls/AspNetMvcEg/actions/workflows/AspNetMvcCI.yml/badge.svg)

ðŸ‘† `VSTest` is a `GitHub Actions` workflow I created for this ASP.NET MVC web app that encourage you to check out if you've had issues setting up workflows for older, "non-Core" .NET applications. To view the file which defines this workflow go [here](https://github.com/pjnalls/AspNetMvcEg/blob/main/.github/workflows/AspNetMvcCI.yml).

<br />

Overall, this repository is intended to be an example of a ASP.NET MVC web app for testing certain ideas and concepts.

<br />

Hopefully, more changes should be coming down the pipeline (or should I say `workflow`... ðŸ˜…).
